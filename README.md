This program allows you to use your voice to enter in shortcuts. It will come "prestocked" with some of the very very basic word editing shortcuts
and photoshop shortcuts, but there is a functionality that allows you to create your own profiles. The way you create profiles such as these would be
as follows

For shortcuts (for example save):

		voice shortcut: save	button shortcut: ctrl + s
		
this would press control and s for you which in most programs saves the file/document

for typing: 
		voice shortcut: word	button shortcut: verylongword

in this example when you said "word" it would type out "very long word"

There is currently no way to delete or edit your profiles but I would like to add that functionality the only way someone could delete their profile
would be to delete it under profiledat/userdat directory then create another profile

The profiles do not have to be created in the GUI you could just create a .dat file with the syntax "voice&buttons" this would work to generate the profile
